# 👋 Hi, I'm Giusy!

I'm a Master's graduate in **Financial Risk and Data Analysis** from Sapienza University. I’m passionate about voatility models, machine learning and AI, the mathematics of financial markets and programming languages. My work bridges financial theory and practice for a comprehensive analysis of the world.

### 🧠  Calibration of the ATM skew using a hybrid approach through rough volatility models and machine learning.

**Hurst exponent estimation in a multiscale framework**, **Multiscale Rough Bergomi model**, **ML**: PCA, Feature importance and XGBoost after hyperparameter tuning for decoding the final ATM skew and implementation of a trading strategy.

The methodology begins by quantifying the multifractal nature of volatility through the estimation of the Hurst exponent across multiple time scales. These varying roughness parameters are then incorporated into a customized rough Bergomi (rBergomi) model, producing a more realistic implied volatility surface across maturities. An Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model is then trained to capture the complex, non-linear relationship between the market's ATM skew and a set of explanatory variables, which include rBergomi-implied volatilities. To enhance predictive performance and interpretability, the feature space is enriched using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and feature importance metrics.

The dissertation has been published and you can read it. 📚[publication](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5369191) .

### 🆕 📊 New in: Dashboard for portfolio analysis: VAR and ES calculated for a portfolio of 4 stocks.
I have created a dashboard for performing the calculation of VAR and ES on a portfolio constructed with TSLA, AAPL, XOM and KO.
The inputs are holding period, confidence level and portfolio weights.
Furthermore you can choose the stocks and see a table with the returns from 2020-01-01 to 2025-08-29 and moreover, it is possible to extract the time series plot.
🗂️ Click [here](https://github.com/yukigiusy/Dashboards/blob/main/VAR_and_ES_dashboard.ipynb) for the code and [here](https://1f93a4af7d89.ngrok-free.app/) to use it (just a little reminder: since I'm using ngrok, it creates a temporary link that works as long as I don't re run the code. It will be my care update it if it will change. Sorry for the incovenient. 😥).

### 📊  Value-at-risk
I've calculated the value at risk and expected shortfall in the case of holding only one stock of TSLA. It is adaptable at every case. The main goal was to capture the differences in the risk metrics!
