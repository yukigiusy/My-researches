title: Giusy – Quantitative Analyst
---

# 👋 Hi, I'm Giusy!

I'm a Master's graduate in **Quantitative Finance and Data Analysis** from Sapienza University. I’m passionate about stochastic models, machine learning, and the mathematics of financial markets. My work bridges theory and practice — from rough volatility modeling to data-driven trading strategies.

Currently looking for opportunities in **Quantitative Analysis, Risk Modeling**, or **Quantitative Research** in Europe.
