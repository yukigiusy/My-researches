# My-researches
Hi, here is a collection of researches and codes on cool topics for me written during my free time! ü§ì

1. **Value-at-risk**: I've calculated the value at risk and expected shortfall in the case of holding only one stock of TSLA. It is adaptable at every case. The main goal was to capture the differences in the risk metrics! [Here](https://github.com/yukigiusy/My-researches/blob/main/VAR_%20(1).ipynb)
2. **Calculating the VIX**: Thanks to the CBOE paper, I've implemented a calculation of the future VIX! [here](https://github.com/yukigiusy/My-researches/blob/main/modelling_vix.ipynb) üöÄ
3. **Momentum trading strategy on energy markets**: exponential moving average and RSI calculation on NewEra Energy and Shell.[here](https://github.com/yukigiusy/My-researches/blob/main/Momentum_energy_markets.ipynb);
4. **Black-Scholes model**: Focus on Brownian motion, Geometric Brownian motion, Ito's lemma, option ptice and volatility smile. [here](https://github.com/yukigiusy/My-researches/blob/main/BSM_d[iving_into_Brownian_motion%2C_Ito's_lemma_and_stock_prices.ipynb);
5. **Heston model** [here](https://github.com/yukigiusy/My-researches/blob/main/Stochastic_volatility%20(1).ipynb)
6. **Local volatility** [here](https://github.com/yukigiusy/My-researches/blob/main/Local_volatility.ipynb)
7. **Thesis**: calibration of the ATM skew using a hybrid approach using rough volatility models and machine learning. [here](https://github.com/yukigiusy/My-researches/blob/main/Thesis.ipynb)
8. **Dahsboard VAR and ES**: üóÇÔ∏è Click [here](https://github.com/yukigiusy/Dashboards/blob/main/VAR_and_ES_dashboard%20(1).ipynb) for the code and [here](https://518279d1c2d8.ngrok-free.app/) to use it (just a little reminder: since I'm using ngrok, it creates a temporary link that works as long as I don't re run the code. It will be my care to update it if it will change. Sorry for the incovenient. üò•).
9. **Options prices using Monte Carlo simulations and control variates**: [here](https://github.com/yukigiusy/My-researches/blob/main/Final_Options_pricing.ipynb)
10. **Operational risk estimation**: Analysis of a synthetic operational risk dataset using exploratory analysis, K-Means clustering, and mixture distributions via EM. Risk metrics including VaR, ES, bootstrap confidence intervals, mean excess and mean loss functions are computed to assess tail risk. Here the [code](https://github.com/yukigiusy/My-researches/blob/main/Operational_risk_estimation.ipynb) and here the [dataset](https://github.com/yukigiusy/My-researches/blob/main/operational_risk_full.csv).
