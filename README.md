Hi, here is a collection of researches and codes on cool topics for me written during my free time! ðŸ¤“

1. **Value-at-risk**: I've calculated the value at risk and expected shortfall in the case of holding only one stock of TSLA. It is adaptable at every case. The main goal was to capture the differences in the risk metrics! [Here](https://github.com/yukigiusy/My-researches/blob/main/VAR_%20(1).ipynb)
2. **Calculating the VIX**: Thanks to the CBOE paper, I've implemented a calculation of the future VIX! [here](https://github.com/yukigiusy/My-researches/blob/main/modelling_vix.ipynb) ðŸš€
3. **Momentum trading strategy on energy markets**: exponential moving average and RSI calculation on NewEra Energy and Shell.[here](https://github.com/yukigiusy/My-researches/blob/main/Momentum_energy_markets.ipynb);
4. **Black-Scholes model**: Focus on Brownian motion, Geometric Brownian motion, Ito's lemma, option ptice and volatility smile. [here](https://github.com/yukigiusy/My-researches/blob/main/BSM_d[iving_into_Brownian_motion%2C_Ito's_lemma_and_stock_prices.ipynb);
5. **Heston model** [here](https://github.com/yukigiusy/My-researches/blob/main/Stochastic_volatility%20(1).ipynb)
6. **Local volatility** [here](https://github.com/yukigiusy/My-researches/blob/main/Local_volatility.ipynb)
