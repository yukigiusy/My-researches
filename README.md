# My-researches
Hi, here is a collection of researches and codes on cool topics for me written during my free time! ðŸ¤“

1. **Value-at-risk**: I've calculated the value at risk and expected shortfall in the case of holding only one stock of TSLA. It is adaptable at every case. The main goal was to capture the differences in the risk metrics! [Here]([url](https://github.com/yukigiusy/My-researches/blob/main/VAR_%20(1).ipynb))
2. **Calculating the VIX**: Thanks to the CBOE paper, I've implemented a calculation of the future VIX! ðŸš€
